technologies used:
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Jquery, and giphy api.

Giphy is an APP that uses AJAX and the Giphy Api to add gif's of the users choice to the page, along with some Philadelphia flavored preselected gifs I've chosen.  Clicking on the Gif icons will start and stop their animation.

Gifs are a part of our everyday expression and life.  Having access to gifs and their start and stop function helps us all.  

further ideations for this project are:
to incorporate a login screen and access to your own collection of gifs, also a way to remove individual gifs and set your own rating level.

next would be a 'childmode' similar to the above but with fewer options to exit out or alter content shown.

Thank you, any feedback provided is a huge gift.
