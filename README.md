GifTastic Giphy API bootcamp assignment 


technologies used:
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Jquery, and giphy api.

Giphy is an APP that uses AJAX and the Giphy Api to add gif's of the users choice to the page, along with some Philadelphia flavored preselected gifs I've chosen.  Clicking on the Gif icons will start and stop their animation.
